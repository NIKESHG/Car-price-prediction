# Car Price Prediction using Linear and Lasso Regression


### This repository contains code for predicting the price of a car using linear and lasso regression. The code uses the following steps:

    • Load the data
    • Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
    • Clean the data
    • Build linear and lasso regression models
    • Evaluate the models
    • Make predictions

#### The data used in this project is a dataset of used cars from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about the cars, such as the make, model, year, mileage, and price.

#### The code is written in Python and uses the following libraries:

    •Pandas
    •NumPy
    •Scikit-learn

### To run the code, clone the repository and install the required libraries. Then, run the following command in the terminal:

    python main.py

    The code will print the results of the model evaluation and the predictions.

### Here is a brief explanation of the different steps involved in the project:

    •Load the data: The data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
    •Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA): EDA is performed to understand the data and identify any potential problems.
    •Clean the data: The data is cleaned to remove any errors or inconsistencies.
    •Build linear and lasso regression models: Linear and lasso regression models are built using the cleaned data.
    •Evaluate the models: The models are evaluated using a holdout set of data.
    •Make predictions: Predictions are made for the test set of data.

#### The results of the project show that the lasso regression model is able to predict the price of a car more accurately than the linear regression model. This is because the lasso regression model penalizes the coefficients of features that are not important, which helps to prevent overfitting.
